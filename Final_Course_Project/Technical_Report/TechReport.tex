	Sleep is a multifactorial physiological phenomenon.
influenced by internal biological processes and external environmental stimuli such external\cite{Sadeh1994}; being a process of such high importance, it makes that studying and controlling it is essential. This technical report collects our work towards the detection of sleep states
through the analysis of accelerometry data and the integration of
probabilistic models that take the environment into account with
variables such as stress, light, noise, and fatigue \cite{AccelerometryReview}, understanding how they influence the probability of movement during transitions from sleep to wakefulness, incorporating our analytical perspectives systemic and incorporation of modular design phases.

The framework implements an event-driven stochastic model events, using MVC architecture in Java with visualization in JavaFx; this is validated with real accelerometry data \cite{Kaggle}  and is incorporated with a probabilistic model that estimates the probability of movement along with a prediction model of sleep state based on activity history, variables environmental factors and circadian modulation. The system applies the algorithms Cole Kripke \cite{ColeKripke}, Sadeh\cite{Sadeh1994} and Opal \cite{Opal2020},and methods of machine learning, including the LLM Chronos time series model\cite{Chronos}, to improve the prediction capability beyond traditional actigraphic methods.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Sleep monitoring has evolved from laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) to portable accelerometry solutions \cite{AccelerometryReview}, driven by the need for continuous non-invasive monitoring. Our work addresses critical gaps identified in current approaches \cite{Sadeh1994}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Limited understanding of environmental influences on movement patterns
    \item Lack of integration between environmental factors and sleep regulation models
    \item Need for controlled simulation environments to study sleep-environment interactions
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significant Advances by Workshop}
Below are the key achievements of each workshop, demonstrating how each phase contributed evolutionarily to the final system:

\subsection{Workshop 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advance 1: Identification of Critical Components
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of key components (data processor, event detection, validator) and their interactions in sleep monitoring systems, revealing sensitivity to chaotic inputs and the importance of robust validation loops.
    
    \item The sleep monitoring system was decomposed into essential modules (data processor, event detector, validator), revealing critical dependencies. This allowed structuring subsequent development and prioritizing vulnerable areas (e.g., sensitivity to accelerometer noise).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 2: Chaos Sensitivity Diagnosis
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It was identified that small variations in accelerometry data (such as Â±0.01g errors in ENMO) could distort sleep classifications. This motivated the inclusion of adaptive filters and dynamic thresholds in the final model.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 3: Validation Loop Proposal
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The detection of false positives/negatives in preliminary analyses led to implementing a cross-validation module in the simulation, improving accuracy by 15\% compared to systems without feedback.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workshop 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advance 4: Scalable Modular Architecture
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A modular architecture was developed addressing findings from Workshop 1, incorporating noise-resistant modeling and adaptive error handling.
    
    \item A structure based on independent pipelines (processing, modeling, validation) was proposed, facilitating integration of new algorithms (e.g., LSTM in final phase) without restructuring the entire system.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 5: Data Preprocessing Strategies
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The design incorporates specific data normalization techniques for each input: Anglez (Range: -1,1) Enmo (Range: 0,1)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 6: Error Handling Protocols
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Mechanisms were defined for failure recovery (reanalysis of corrupt data), avoiding infinite loops detected in Workshop 1. This increased system reliability in real environments.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workshop 3:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advance 7: Stochastic Event Modeling
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of Poisson processes for environmental events (lights, noises) allowed simulating realistic perturbations, capturing nonlinearities in sleep-wake transitions that deterministic models ignore.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 8: Physiological Calibration
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ENMO parameters (\(\mu_{\text{sleep}} = 0.01\,g\)) and Anglez (\(\sigma_{\theta,\text{awake}} = 15^\circ\)) were adjusted using empirical data from Kaggle, achieving 89\% alignment with real human patterns.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 9: Integration of Previous Findings
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We unified advances from Workshops 1 and 2 into a coherent system: Used Workshop 2's modularity to incorporate Workshop 1's validator. Applied anti-chaos strategies from both workshops in the stochastic model.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Advance 10: Validation with Real Data
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulations replicated real data with less than 5\% error (ENMO at step 39), demonstrating that the theoretical framework can translate to practical applications.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Integrated Framework Development}
Our methodology combines perspectives from all phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Workshop 1: System decomposition, chaos sensitivity analysis.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Final integration: Event-driven architecture with feedback validation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Workshop 2: Modular design, robustness strategies.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Final integration: MVC implementation with error handling.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Final integration: Hybrid approach in simulation logic.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event-Based Simulation Model}
The core mathematical framework models sleep system dynamics as a stochastic interaction between environmental factors, physiological variables, and the temporal structure of human behavior. We employ a discrete event-based approach complemented by continuous components that capture natural environmental variability and its impact on motor activity.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Environmental Factors (Stochastic Processes):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $X_i(t+1) = X_i(t) + \epsilon_i(t) + \Delta X_{i,\text{event}}(t)$ 
    Where \(\epsilon_i(t)\) represents Gaussian random fluctuations and \(\Delta X_{i,\text{event}}\) discrete events such as light activation, sudden noises, or posture changes. These events are simulated through Poisson processes, enabling time-variable randomness generation.
    \end{itemize}
    
\item Movement Probability (via Logistic Regression):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\text{movement}}(t) = \sigma\big( \beta_0 + \beta_L L(t) + \beta_S S(t) + \beta_\sigma \sigma_s(t) + \beta_{\text{sleep}} I_{\text{sleep}}(t) \big)\).
    \item This component estimates instantaneous movement probability as a logistic function of external variables like light (\(L\)), stress (\(S\)), and fatigue/variability (\(\sigma_s\)), plus a corrective factor if the subject is already asleep. The \(\beta\) coefficients are empirically calibrated to reflect physiological sensitivity observed in real accelerometry data.
    \end{itemize}
    
\item Sleep Probability (Incorporating Circadian Rhythms):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \(P_{\text{sleep}}(t) = \sigma\big( \alpha_0 + \alpha_A A(t) + \alpha_L L(t) + \alpha_S S(t) + \alpha_\sigma \sigma_s(t) \big) \cdot C_{\text{circadian}}(t)\)
    \item Sleep state is modeled as a probability function dependent on multiple environmental factors, modulated by a circadian component \(C_{\text{circadian}}(t)\) that introduces low-frequency oscillations tied to time of day. This term adjusts baseline sleep probability according to rest-prone windows (e.g., nighttime) while suppressing probability during typically active hours. The combination reflects sleep-wake system sensitivity to both internal and external perturbations, consistent with observations in real biological systems.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

        \item Achieved precision improvements in detecting longest sleep periods.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusions}
This project presents the modular development of a system for predicting sleep states using accelerometry data and stochastically modeled environmental factors. Across three workshops, we consolidated a robust MVC-based architecture with continuous validation, noise-resistant processing, and simulation of environmental events through Poisson processes. The combination of classical models (Sadeh, Cole-Kripke, OPAL) with modern techniques like the Chronos LLM time series model allowed us to explore the limits of actigraphic prediction in complex, chaotic scenarios.

Algorithm comparison revealed clear behavioral differences: Cole-Kripke showed the best balance between precision and accuracy with an F1-score of 0.185, while OPAL, despite being globally less accurate, achieved the highest F1-score of 0.2853, excelling in detecting sleep-wake transitions. Results consistent with system simulations show that simulated ENMO and Anglez values closely approximate real data.

The use of Chronos LLM, specialized in time series, improved consistency and detection of binary sleep fragmentation, demonstrating the potential of using LLMs as support. The gains in consistency and ability to model long patterns demonstrate its value.
