 \begin{itemize}
     \item \footnotesize Sleep is a fundamental complex biological process composed of \textbf{several distinct states} which interruptions  or unbalanced on this process may come with important  \textbf{physical and mental health issues}, affecting millions worldwide and are linked to chronic diseases.
     \item \footnotesize Traditionally sleep had been studied using Polysomnography (PSG) a technology that captures detailed physiological signals. However, \textbf{PSG requires specialized facilities,
     trained technicians, and sophisticated instrumentation}.
     \item Recent advances in wearable technology have enabled the use of accelerometers as a non-invasive, low-cost alternative for sleep state prediction. These sensors, embedded in consumer devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers, measure body movement to infer sleep and wake state:

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system is linear and deterministic, with modular components depending on the correct functioning of previous stages and a feedback loop that reinitializes processing to resolve errors and enhance reliability.

  \item  A built-in validation module ensures error tolerance by detecting anomalies and reprocessing data from the point of failure to maintain result integrity.

  \item A data filtering mechanism restricts invalid or irrelevant input under certain conditions to ensure only valid data is processed.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
      \item  The architecture follows a modular and structured pipeline: raw data is processed (normalization, filtering, smoothing), features are extracted, and relevant data is sent to a deep learning model for event detection.

      \item  Detected events go through validation and are then formatted and exported; this modular flow supports scalability, reuse, and adaptability to changing data or models.

     \item  Components can be tested and upgraded independently, improving system robustness, fault tolerance, and resilience to data variability and randomness.

     \item  Limitations include sensitivity to chaotic inputs (e.g., sleep disturbances from medication), environmental randomness, and sensor failures, requiring continuous adaptation and relying on advanced validation and pre-trained LLMs to reduce false outcomes.
